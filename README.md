## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I need to add a height property to my flex container in order to center it vertically.
I learned that align-self property will only work on a direct child element.
I learned how to work with an svg.
I learned how to overlay a div on top of a div and showcase it on a hover state.

### Continued development
 
 Im still relying too much on the margin properties because I cannot understand how the flex item property works. I will continue to work on flexbox challenges until I can totally understand how to center all elements using the flex property for container and items.
